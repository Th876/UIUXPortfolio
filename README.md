<p>
This website is my professional UI/UX portfolio, which I designed and developed in my GIT 418 course at <a href="https://www.asu.edu/">Arizona State University</a> for my final project. The wireframe for this project was created via Figma, and was coded using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and AJAX. The purpose of this portfolio is to showcase my projects in UI/UX design, graphic design, and front-end development. </p>

<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>Since it was my first time using jQuery, I found it quite challenging to use its plugins and/or libraries. I particularly struggled with properly implementing the slideshow feature but quickly remembered to heavily rely on my developer tools for customization. 
</p>

<hr></hr>

<h3>Successes</h3>
<p>Although this project came with its fair share of challenges, I enjoyed the research process, particularly researching popular UI trends that would not only create a great user experience but also reflect who I am as a designer/developer. Also, I enjoyed discovering <a href="https://webflow.com/blog/glassmorphism#:~:text=Web%20designers%20have%20come%20up,and%20dimensionality%20to%20the%20design.">glassmorphism</a> the most, and learning how to apply it to create an overall sleek design.</p>

<hr></hr>
<h3>Future Enhancements</h3>
<p>In the future, I would like to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple HTML files: Since my design is somewhat limited to the confinements of this project, I would remove the slideshow and use a grid layout to display my projects. I would also include a ‘View’ button so that users can navigate to my projects’ case studies. </li>
<li>User authentication so that the event planner’s 
information is secure </li>
<li>A live chat feature in which the event planner can 
communicate directly with clients.</li>
</ul>
