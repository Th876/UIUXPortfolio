# UI/UX Portfolio


<p>
This website is my professional UI/UX portfolio, which I designed and developed in my GIT 418 course at <a href="https://www.asu.edu/">Arizona State University</a> for my final project. The project was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and AJAX. The purpose of this portfolio is to showcase my projects in UI/UX design.</p>

<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>Since it was my first time using jQuery, I found it quite challenging to use its plugins and/or libraries.
</p>

<h3>Successes</h3>
<p>Although this project came with its fair share of challenges, I enjoyed the research process, particularly researching popular UI trends that would not only create a great user experience but also reflect who I am as a designer/developer.</p>

<hr></hr>
<h3>Future Enhancements</h3>
<p>In the future, I would like to:</p>
<ul>
<li>More than One HTML file: Since my design is somewhat limited to the confinements of this project, I would remove the slideshow and use a grid layout to display my projects. I would also include a ‘View’ button so that users can navigate to my projects’ case studies. </li>
<li>Progress Bar: Given that my portfolio will include my own work and the content will extend the length of my portfolio, I would like to incorporate a progress bar as a form of navigation aid to enhance user experience.</li>
<li>Mobile-friendly: Developing a mobile version of my portfolio would be beneficial as it would demonstrate that I am capable of utilizing responsive design techniques.</li>
</ul>
