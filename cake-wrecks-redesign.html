                    Now, this is where the design started to look like<br> the final product. I refined the wireframes into a<br>high-fidelity mockup by adding color and high-quality images. I also introduced an intuitive navigation, a carousel, and new features like login and sign-up options, a newsletter form, and an interactive map.

                <p> 
                    For the mobile view, I chose a list view over an interactive map because it's simpler and more user-friendly on smaller screens. It allows users to quickly scan through bakery options without the hassle of zooming and scrolling on a map.

                    Since tablets don't offer as much screen space<br> as desktops, I used an embedded interactive map instead of a modal pop-up to optimize the user experience.

            <div class="body-left">
                <p>To tackle the mixed reviews, I went back to the drawing board. This iterative design process led me to design a more organized list that makes finding bakeries both intuitive and efficient. From there, I began the A/B testing.

                    I brought in six new participants from the screener survey pool who had an interest in cake fails. They performed the task of finding a bakery in Atlanta, Georgia, and shared their thoughts on the design.

            <p>Interestingly, the test results showed that users were equally split between the interactive map and the list, which led to my final redesign decision—a toggle feature. This feature allows users to toggle between the interactive map view (now an embedded map) and a list view.</p>

            <p class="sentence-margin-top">Here's how each option of the toggle feature serves different user needs:</p>

                    I also introduced the toggle feature on the tablet view to give users flexibility between options. But for the phone view, no changes were made after the first observation test. Why? Because on smaller screens, less is more. This way, users can easily find what they need without the fuss of zooming and scrolling.
